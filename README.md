A comprehensive starter kit for rapid application development using React.

Why Slingshot?

1. **One command to get started** - Type `npm start` to start development in your default browser.
2. **Rapid feedback** - Each time you hit save, changes hot reload and linting and automated tests run.
3. **One command line to check** - All feedback is displayed on a single command line.
4. **No more JavaScript fatigue** - Slingshot uses [the most popular and powerful libraries](#technologies) for working with React.
5. **Working example app** - The included example app shows how this all works together.
6. **Automated production build** - Type `npm run build` to do all this:

# Get Started

1. **Initial Machine Setup**

    First time running the starter kit? Then complete the [Initial Machine Setup](#initial-machine-setup).

2. **Click "Use this template"**

    Click the green "Use this template" button at the top of this page and enter a name and description for your repo.

3. **Run the setup script**

    `npm run setup`

4. **Run the example app**

    `npm start -s`

    This will run the automated build process, start up a webserver, and open the application in your default browser. When doing development with this kit, this command will continue watching all your files. Every time you hit save the code is rebuilt, linting runs, and tests run automatically. Note: The -s flag is optional. It enables silent mode which suppresses unnecessary messages during the build.

5. **Review the example app.**

    This starter kit includes a working example app that calculates fuel savings. Note how all source code is placed under /src. Tests are placed alongside the file under test. The final built app is placed under /dist. These are the files you run in production.

6. **Delete the example app files.**

    Once you're comfortable with how the example app works, you can [delete those files and begin creating your own app](./docs/FAQ.md#i-just-want-an-empty-starter-kit).

7. **Having issues?** See [Having Issues?](#having-issues-try-these-things-first).

## Initial Machine Setup

1. **Install [Node 8.0.0 or greater](https://nodejs.org)**

    Need to run multiple versions of Node? Use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

2. **Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)**.

3. **[Disable safe write in your editor](https://webpack.js.org/guides/development/#adjusting-your-text-editor)** to assure hot reloading works properly.

4. Complete the steps below for your operating system:

    ### macOS

    * Install [watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) via `brew install watchman` or fswatch via `brew install fswatch` to avoid [this issue](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/871) which occurs if your macOS has no appropriate file watching service installed.

    ### Linux

    * Run this to [increase the limit](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16748737/grunt-watch-error-waiting-fatal-error-watch-enospc) on the number of files Linux will watch. [Here's why](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot/issues/6).

        `echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p`.

    ### Windows
    
    * **Install [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**. Some node modules may rely on node-gyp, which requires Python on Windows.
    * **Install C++ Compiler**. Browser-sync requires a C++ compiler on Windows.
    
      [Visual Studio Express](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-US/products/visual-studio-express-vs) comes bundled with a free C++ compiler.
      
      If you already have Visual Studio installed:
      Open Visual Studio and go to File -> New -> Project -> Visual C++ -> Install Visual C++ Tools for Windows Desktop.
      The C++ compiler is used to compile browser-sync (and perhaps other Node modules).

## Having Issues? Try these things first

1. Make sure you ran all steps in [Get started](#get-started) including the [initial machine setup](#initial-machine-setup).
2. Run `npm install` - If you forget to do this, you'll see this: `babel-node: command not found`.
3. Install the latest version of Node.
4. Make sure files with names that begin with a dot (.editorconfig, .gitignore, .npmrc) are copied to the project directory root. This is easy to overlook if you copy this repository manually.
5. Don't run the project from a symbolic link. It may cause issues with file watches.
6. Delete any .eslintrc that you're storing in your user directory. Also, disable any ESLint plugin / custom rules that you've enabled within your editor. These will conflict with the ESLint rules defined in this project.
7. Make sure you don't have NODE_ENV set to production on your machine. If you do then the [development dependencies won't be installed](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot/issues/400#issuecomment-290497767). Here's [how to check](http://stackoverflow.com/a/27939821/26180).
8. Install watchman with `brew install watchman` if you are having the following error after an initial `npm start -s`:

    ```bash
    2017-09-05 00:44 node[68587] (FSEvents.framework) FSEventStreamStart: register_with_server: ERROR: f2d_register_rpc() => (null) (-22)
    2017-09-05 00:44 node[68587] (FSEvents.framework) FSEventStreamStart: register_with_server: ERROR: f2d_register_rpc() => (null) (-22)
    events.js:160
          throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event
          ^

    Error: Error watching file for changes: EMFILE
        at exports._errnoException (util.js:1022:11)
        at FSEvent.FSWatcher._handle.onchange (fs.js:1406:11)
    ```

9. Tip: Things to check if you get an `npm run lint` error or build error:

    * If ESW found an error or warning in your project (e.g. console statement or a missing semi-colon), the lint thread will exit with `Exit status 1`. To fix:

      1. Change the `npm run lint` script to `"esw webpack.config.* src tools; exit 0"`
      1. Change the `npm run lint:watch` script to `"esw webpack.config.* src tools --watch; exit 0"`

      > Note: Adding `exit 0` will allow the npm scripts to ignore the status 1 and allow ESW to print all warnings and errors.
    * Ensure the `eslint`/`esw` globally installed version matches the version used in the project. This will ensure the `esw` keyword is resolved.

10. Rebuild node-sass with `npm rebuild node-sass` if you are having and error like `Node Sass does not yet support your current environment on macOS XXX` after an initial `npm start -s`.
